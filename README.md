# Web3-Wallet
[Live Demo...]()

## About

I have created a Web3 WebApp using which user can send transection through blockchain and these transection then would be 
linked with a gif and would be stored which can be viewed by user later. The frontend is developed using Reactjs which is a very
famous technology for front with which used vite which made development process even seemless. Used Solidity to implement Smart 
Contract that generate a chain of transaction records in the blockchain system.
